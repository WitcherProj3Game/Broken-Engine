# Broken Engine by Broken Gem Studio
Broken Engine is a 3D Game Engine developed with C++ and based on OpenGL and developed by students of the Degree in Videogames Design and Development of Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya for the Project III subject of 3rd course.

We used as basis for the engine (fork), the Aitor Simona's [Central 3D Engine](https://github.com/AitorSimona/CENTRAL-3D).

## TOOLS & LIBRARIES USED

We used [SDL 2.0.10](https://www.libsdl.org/), STL, [OpenGL 4.4](https://www.opengl.org/) with [GLAD 0.1.33](https://glad.dav1d.de/), [ImGui 1.72b](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [GPUDetect](https://github.com/GameTechDev/gpudetect), [MMGR](https://www.flipcode.com/archives/Presenting_A_Memory_Manager.shtml), [ParShapes](https://prideout.net/shapes), [Assimp 3.3](http://www.assimp.org/), [Devil 1.8.0](http://openil.sourceforge.net/), [JSON for Modern C++](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/), [ImGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo).

In Addition:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 
- Visual Studio Code
- MathGeoLib 1.5 (commit 1994)
- PhysFS
- PhysX 3.4.2 
- Recast Navigation
- Optick 1.3.0


## HOW TO USE
There is no formal installation process, just look around and play with it.

* Navigation: Mouse and Keyboard controls are enabled both on UI and Scene, working on focused window only.
* Mouse picking: Self-explainable, click on an object to select it, notice how inspector info changes, but if the object is hidden
in the hierarchy you won't notice it there, open parent to see how it is selected.
* Asset Import: Drop it into the editor.
* Scene Camera:
- Right Mouse button enables Look Around
- Alt + Left Mouse button enables Camera Orbit
- Mouse Wheel click enables camera Pan
- Right Mouse button + WASD enables free movement
- Mouse Wheel movement enables zoom

Editor camera only works when in AppState EDITOR mode.

* Guizmo: Move (W), Rotate (E) and Scale (R), or from EditorUI (while editor camera is moving, guizmo is frozen)

**Note:** Do not modify config file, it will modify engine's configuration. And please, don't delete the dll or exe files, they are needed for the engine to work. In fact, do not touch any engine's inner files in Library or Settings, please.

## DEBUG FEATURES
